# FuneralClient
 A client for vrchat made in c# to provide more shit and utilities to make VRChat a better game <br />
 
 # Reasoning
 This game is updating to Unity 2018 soon, breaking all mono cheats since Unity 2018 uses il2cpp. :( 
 If anyone can find a way to port this over, please do so. I want someone else to revive this in the future if possible

  # SETTING UP THE CLIENT
  Obviously you'll need to remove the auth checks to my server, after that just build it and modify the Loader a bit so it doesnt auto  update and boom, inject, there you go.
